this Project implects the interfaces node_ongo,wegited_graph_algorithems and weigthed graph.
the classes the implements this interfaces are NodeInfo WGraphDS and WGraphAlgo

the NodeInfo contains:
1) a hashMap of all the Node thats neigbhors to the node 
2)info
3)tag
4)key- each Nodes have indvidual key number
5) last neigbhor key- the key of the last Neigbor when we search the shortest path
6)counters for the methods
7)hashMap of the value of the weight edge(it save only in the min key nodeInfo)

the WGraphDs contains:
1)hashMap of all the nodes in the graph
2)counters for the methods

the GraphAlgo contains:
1)a graph
2)priorty quy
3)counters for the method

on this project u can create graph add/remoce nodes and connect/unconnect nodes to each pthers. 
also u can  check if the graph is connect/unconnect 
and to check what is the shortest path between two nodes and u can get the shortest path on a List

u can also save anf load the graph to text file
